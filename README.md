# skippy-cov

## Overview

`skippy-cov` is a tool that optimizes your Python testing workflow by filtering tests based on code changes. It takes a diff file from Git and a `.coverage` database (generated by `coverage.py`) to identify and run only the tests relevant to the modified code. This significantly reduces testing time and resources.


## Usage

1.  **Generate a Diff File:** Create a diff file using Git.

    ```bash
git diff > my_changes.diff
    ```

2.  **Run Coverage Analysis:** Generate a `.coverage` database using `coverage.py`.

    ```bash
coverage run -m pytest
coverage report
    ```

3.  **Filter Tests with skippy-cov:** Use `skippy-cov` to filter tests based on the diff file and coverage database.

    ```bash
pytest $(skippy-cov --diff-file my_changes.diff --coverage-map-file .coverage)
    ```

## Configuration

`skippy-cov` can be configured using command-line arguments. See `skippy-cov --help` for more information.
