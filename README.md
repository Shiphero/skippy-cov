# skippy-cov

## Overview

`skippy-cov` is a tool that optimizes your Python testing workflow by filtering tests based on code changes. It takes a diff file from git and a `.coverage` database (generated by [`coverage.py`](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/)) to identify and run only the tests relevant to the modified code. This significantly reduces testing time and resources.


## Usage

To use this, you first need to generate the following required files:

* **Generate a Diff File:** Create a diff file using Git.

```bash
    git diff > changes.diff
```

* **Run Coverage Analysis:** Generate a `.coverage` database using `coverage.py`.

```bash
    coverage run -m pytest
```

Now, `skippy-cov` can be ran as a standalone script that will list the relevant tests.

```bash
    skippy-cov --diff-file changes.diff --coverage-map-file .coverage
```

But it can also be used as `pytest` plugin:

```bash
    pytest --skippy-cov --skippy-cov-diff-file changes.diff --skippy-cov-coverage-map-file .coverage
```

which would be the equivalent of doing this:

```bash
    pytest $(skippy-cov --diff-file changes.diff --coverage-map-file .coverage)
```

## Configuration

`skippy-cov` can be configured using command-line arguments. See `skippy-cov --help` for more information.
